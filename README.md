# What-Now-iOS

### "What Now" is an iOS application that lets you read top-headlines news with categories:
- General News
- Technology News
- Business News

It starts with a **Splash Screen** then navigates to the **Home Screen** where you can select your desired category.
The data is shown via a **Table View** and each **Cell** consists of an image for the news and its title.
Clicking on each cell navigates to the original news web page.
